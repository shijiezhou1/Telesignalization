# Telesignalization
Telesignalization, an intimacy predictingÂ machine with both partners, was used to measure the different stages of relationship based on how far they standÂ fromÂ the people next to them. Usually, most of us do not pay attention to the boundary between yourself and others. The inspiration onÂ telesignalizationÂ machine is playing the different role of surveillance camera, which is the role of an advance fortune-telling machine. Each of us has a different physical reaction and observable emotion associated with individuals, as well as the human gender. TheÂ boxÂ ofÂ display can give such relationship data analysis about thatÂ personâ€™s life. With the rise of quantization, this project can emphasize the awareness of body language or spacial awareness in the society.Â

ABOUT HOW:  
The Telesignalization device is made of a Adurino or Makey Makey. The monitor is installed on the box, and the box is made of black cardboard. The monitor connect to the small desktop/computer, and the camera is set up on the top center. It is a 1440x900 monitor. 

It is using the application - Processing.  The opencv library ( OpenCV - API ) and the FaceDetection is sufficient to use for the project. The mainly focus is detecting the eyes and the oval shape of the face. If the face is being trackedï¼Œ then the live data/chart will displace a result.Without anyone standing in front of the camera, the screen only show blank.

ABOUT WHY:  
A 21st, century, camera in the public space has become surveillance cameras. The reason I used a camera capture for my project is to reform the modern video surveillance system to be an interesting capture system. The audiences are able to see the result and data statistics on the screen. There are five different stages about relationships, which it is from strong to week. With the special idea, surveillance cameraÂ can accomplish the measurement of two people relationship.

The effectiveness of telesignalization depends on some basic assumptions about the knowledge and real world experience that is common between the two people in the public. Â As human relationship became more sophisticated over the last thousand years, the cameraÂ became capable of storing people location's distanceÂ as quantity.

TimeLine: 
Week 1: Brainstorming ideas and listing all the thought for a senior project.

Week 2:Â  Presenting the proposal in class to receive feedback from classmates. Revising the idea if there is a flaw.

Week 3:Â  Introduce about the timeline and organize the work time with the project

Starting to look into the performance art software like Processing

Week 4:Â  Finding all the audio, images, and videos for my presentation installation.Â 

Week 5:Â  Midterm - Showing the presentation to the class. And receive possible feedback for the project

Week 6:Â  Improving the performance by changing it. Organizing the videos source and music soundtrack for the performance. Adding specific details or different musical elements to the projects. Deciding for the three relevant work

Week 7:Â  Setting up for the Makey Makey/Â AdurinoÂ for the controlled

Week 8:Â  Adding more coding or stuff for the Makey Makey

Week 9:Â  Adding more elements to theÂ Adurino key

Week 10: Giving a final presentation of the entire project, and thinking of improvement for next quarter.Â 

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â ðŸ› 

Week 11:Â  Introduce the project and review for the concept that it has.

Week 12:Â  Order some materials such as crystal balls, cable, table, mini laptop, record camera, and boxÂ 

Week 13:Â  Organizing all the timeline and maintain the website also publish and upload and starting to prepare to record the project

Week 14:Â  Visit professors to help with bug on the projectÂ in orderÂ make the code moreÂ efficient while running

Week 15:Â  Midterm crit: double check with the code and make sure everything works fine on the different location

Week 16:Â  Testing all the possible mistake for the performance

Week 17:Â  Retesting all the performance issue

Week 18:Â  FinishingÂ all the code and Present the complete website

Week 19:Â  Finishing the final present project plan and Final Presentations

Week 20:Â Install and performance
