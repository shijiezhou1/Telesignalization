# Telesignalization
Telesignalization, an intimacy predicted machine within both partners, was used to measure the different levels of relationship based on how close people standing next to each other. People rarely pay attention to how far they stand the one next to. The inspiration on telesignalization machine is playing the different role of surveillance camera, which it is an advanced fortune-telling machine. The behavior and motion are exposed under the camera, and turn into a specific data analysis showing on the monitor. The key of the project is not only giving an ironic situation, but also emphasize the significant relationship level in the reality.

ABOUT HOW:
The Telesignalization device is made of a Adurino or Makey Makey. The monitor is installed on the box, and the box is made of black cardboard. The monitor connect to the small desktop/computer, and the camera is set up on the top center. It is a 1440x900 monitor. 

It is using the application - Processing.  The opencv library ( OpenCV - API ) and the FaceDetection is sufficient to use for the project. The mainly focus is detecting the eyes and the oval shape of the face. If the face is being trackedï¼Œ then the live data/chart will displace a result.Without anyone standing in front of the camera, the screen only show blank.

ABOUT WHY: 

A 21st, century, camera in the public space has become surveillance cameras. The reason I used a camera capture for my project is that I want to show a staining technology image analysis of what is considered "stereotype of arts" forms and impress viewers with the new technology use in modern day. It can incorporate with the computing art. 

In this piece, I want to use the camera as the representation of digital artwork. It expressed a shift from traditional to digital does not mean choosing one or the other, but the ability to incorporate the two into a functioning piece. The piece is to show the evolution of the use of the camera, and also the data analysis based on the intimacy level. Usually, it is commonly represented on stocks, market, or value. 

I also choose to use the concept of un-prediction in order to show an interesting result when the user standing in front of the project. Typically, users need to input their birthday, ages, and personal information to receive the data analysis. By using the camera, I am taking advantage of the camera detection technique and OpenCV library. As the Artificial intelligence develop, facial recognition is being used in most of the different areas such as cellphone, home security lock, and clock in the system. In the whole project setup, I will demonstrate what is interesting part by revealing the camera science through the use of face detection.
