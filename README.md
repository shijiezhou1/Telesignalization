# Telesignalization
Telesignalization, an intimacy predicting machine with both partners, was used to measure the different stages of relationship based on how far they stand from the people next to them. Usually, most of us do not pay attention to the boundary between yourself and others. The inspiration on telesignalization machine is playing the different role of surveillance camera, which is the role of an advance fortune-telling machine. Each of us has a different physical reaction and observable emotion associated with individuals, as well as the human gender. The box of display can give such relationship data analysis about that person’s life. With the rise of quantization, this project can emphasize the awareness of body language or spacial awareness in the society.

ABOUT HOW:  
The Telesignalization device is made of a Adurino or Makey Makey. The monitor is installed on the box, and the box is made of black cardboard. The monitor connect to the small desktop/computer, and the camera is set up on the top center. It is a 1440x900 monitor. 

It is using the application - Processing.  The opencv library ( OpenCV - API ) and the FaceDetection is sufficient to use for the project. The mainly focus is detecting the eyes and the oval shape of the face. If the face is being tracked， then the live data/chart will displace a result.Without anyone standing in front of the camera, the screen only show blank.

ABOUT WHY:  
A 21st, century, camera in the public space has become surveillance cameras. The reason I used a camera capture for my project is to reform the modern video surveillance system to be an interesting capture system. The audiences are able to see the result and data statistics on the screen. There are five different stages about relationships, which it is from strong to week. With the special idea, surveillance camera can accomplish the measurement of two people relationship.

The effectiveness of telesignalization depends on some basic assumptions about the knowledge and real world experience that is common between the two people in the public.  As human relationship became more sophisticated over the last thousand years, the camera became capable of storing people location's distance as quantity.
