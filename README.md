# Telesignalization
Telesignalization, an intimacy predictingÂ machine with both partners, was used to measure the different stages of relationship based on how far they standÂ fromÂ the people next to them. Usually, most of us do not pay attention to the boundary between yourself and others. The inspiration onÂ the telesignalizationÂ machine is playing the different role of the surveillance camera, which is the role of an advance fortune-telling machine. Each of us has a different physical reaction and observable emotion associated with individuals, as well as human gender. TheÂ boxÂ of the display can give such relationship data analysis about thatÂ personâ€™s life. With the rise of quantization, this project can emphasize the awareness of body language or spatial awareness in society.Â

### ABOUT HOW:  
The Telesignalization device is made of an Arduino or Makey Makey. The monitor is installed on the box, and the box is made of black cardboard. The monitor connects to the small desktop/computer, and the camera is set up on the top center. It is a 1440x900 monitor. 

It is using the application - Processing.  The OpenCV library ( OpenCV - API ) and face detection is sufficient to use for the project. They mainly focus is detecting the eyes and the oval shape of the face. If the face is being trackedï¼Œ then the live data/chart will displace a result. Without anyone standing in front of the camera, the screen only shows blank.

### ABOUT WHY:  
A 21st, century, camera in the public space has become surveillance cameras. The reason I used a camera capture for my project is to reform the modern video surveillance system to be an interesting capture system. The audiences can see the result and data statistics on the screen. There are five different stages of relationships, which are from strong to week. With the special idea, the surveillance cameraÂ can accomplish the measurement of two people's relationship.

The effectiveness of telesignalization depends on some basic assumptions about the knowledge and real-world experience that is common between the two people in the public. Â As the human relationship became more sophisticated over the last thousand years, the cameraÂ became capable of storing people's location's distanceÂ as quantity.

TimeLine: 
Week 1: Brainstorming ideas and listing all the thought for a senior project.

Week 2:Â  Presenting the proposal in class to receive feedback from classmates. Revising the idea if there is a flaw.

Week 3:Â  Introduce the timeline and organize the work time with the project

Starting to look into the performance art software like Processing

Week 4:Â  Finding all the audio, images, and videos for my presentation installation.Â 

Week 5:Â  Midterm - Showing the presentation to the class. And receive possible feedback for the project

Week 6:Â  Improving performance by changing it. Organizing the video source and music soundtrack for the performance. Adding specific details or different musical elements to the projects. Deciding on the three relevant work

Week 7:Â  Setting up for the Makey Makey/Â ArduinoÂ for the controlled

Week 8:Â  Adding more coding or stuff for the Makey Makey

Week 9:Â  Adding more elements to theÂ Arduino key

Week 10: Giving a final presentation of the entire project, and thinking of improvement for the next quarter.Â 

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â ðŸ› 

Week 11:Â  Introduce the project and review the concept that it has.

Week 12:Â  Order some materials such as crystal balls, cable, mini laptop, record camera, and boxÂ 

Week 13:Â  Organizing all the timeline and maintain the website also publish and upload and starting to prepare to record the project

Week 14:Â  Visit professors to help with a bug on the projectÂ to make the code moreÂ efficient while running

Week 15:Â  Midterm crit: double-check with the code and make sure everything works fine on the different location

Week 16:Â  Testing all the possible mistake for the performance

Week 17:Â  Retesting all the performance issue

Week 18:Â  FinishingÂ all the code and Present the complete website

Week 19:Â  Finishing the final present project plan and Final Presentations

Week 20:Â Install and performance
